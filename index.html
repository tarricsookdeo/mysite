          <p class="text-center">
            I believe code can do anything. It can help us cure diseases, enable
            new experiences, enable us to explore the stars, and help create
            opportunities for everyone. I wrote my first lines of code years ago
            out of curiosity and fell in love with it. Even though software can
            do anything, a specific application I love using if for is in the
            field of finance. Think budgeting apps, fraud detection, and trading
            bots. The challenges in financial technology (fintech) are complex
            and I get very passionate about them. When not writing code, a
            strong passion of mine is astronomy. I took up the hobby of
            astrophotography recently in hopes of getting some cool pictures
            of the night sky. You can check out my photos here.
